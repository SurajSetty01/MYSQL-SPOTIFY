In my database project, I seamlessly integrated SQL and Python to establish a robust system for extracting and managing Spotify track data. Initially, utilizing Python's capabilities, I extracted track information from Spotify's API, gathering essential details such as track name, artist, album, duration, and popularity. This data was then meticulously organized and stored within a MySQL database, ensuring efficient retrieval and management.

Building upon this foundation, I employed the Streamlit library in Python to craft a user-friendly interface for the Spotify track database management system. Users are empowered with a range of functionalities, including the addition of new tracks, deletion of existing ones, and seamless search capabilities based on artist, album, or track name. 

The system's intuitive design and streamlined functionalities provide users with a seamless experience in managing their Spotify track collection. Additionally, by leveraging Streamlit's interactive features, the interface offers real-time feedback, enhancing user engagement and efficiency.

Overall, this project exemplifies the synergy between data extraction, database management, and user interface design, offering a comprehensive solution for organizing and managing Spotify track data effectively.
